If your project is specifically for the *Google Solution Challenge, the focus should be on aligning with the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs)* and leveraging *Google technologies* to create a meaningful impact. Since waste management ties closely with SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 13 (Climate Action), your app should emphasize sustainability, innovation, and scalability.

Hereâ€™s an updated and refined prompt tailored for the *Google Solution Challenge*:

---

*Prompt:*

"I am building a waste management app for the *Google Solution Challenge, and it needs to align with the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs)*. The app currently has a good UI on Replit, but the core functionalities like waste classification, waste map, and analytics dashboard are not working due to API key issues. Hereâ€™s what I need:

1. *Alignment with UN SDGs:*
   - Ensure the app addresses *SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), **SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and **SDG 13 (Climate Action)*.
   - Highlight how the app promotes sustainability, reduces waste, and encourages responsible consumption.

2. *Fix API Key Issues:*
   - If the current API keys are not working, suggest alternatives or create a custom model for waste classification and mapping.
   - Use *Google Cloud APIs* (e.g., Google Maps API, Google Vision API, or Google Cloud AI) for waste classification, mapping, and analytics.
   - If API keys are unavailable, guide me on how to train a custom machine learning model for waste classification using *TensorFlow* or *PyTorch* and deploy it on *Google Cloud*.

3. *Core Functionalities:*
   - *Waste Classification:* Implement a feature where users can upload images of waste, and the app classifies it into categories (e.g., recyclable, organic, hazardous) using *Google Vision API* or a custom-trained model.
   - *Waste Map:* Integrate a map feature to locate nearby waste disposal or recycling centers using *Google Maps API*.
   - *Analytics Dashboard:* Create a dashboard that visualizes waste disposal trends, user contributions, and environmental impact metrics using *Google Data Studio* or *Looker*.

4. *Google Technologies:*
   - Use *Google Cloud Platform (GCP)* for backend services, including *Firebase* for real-time database and authentication.
   - Leverage *Google Vision API* for image-based waste classification or train a custom model using *Google Colab*.
   - Use *Google Data Studio* or *Looker* for advanced analytics and visualization.
   - Integrate *Google Fit API* (optional) to encourage users to track eco-friendly activities like walking or cycling to recycling centers.

5. *Innovative and Hackathon-Winning Features:*
   - Add *gamification elements* like rewards for proper waste disposal and a community leaderboard to encourage user participation.
   - Include *AI-driven insights* to suggest personalized waste reduction tips based on user behavior.
   - Implement *real-time notifications* to remind users of recycling schedules or nearby waste collection events.
   - Add a *carbon footprint tracker* to show users the environmental impact of their waste disposal habits.

6. *Fallback Plan:*
   - If API keys are not an option, guide me on how to build a custom waste classification model using open-source datasets (e.g., TACO dataset for waste classification) and deploy it on *Google Cloud*.
   - Use open-source mapping tools like *OpenStreetMap* as an alternative to Google Maps.

7. *Code and Deployment:*
   - Provide clean, modular, and well-documented code.
   - Ensure the app is deployable on *Replit* and scalable for future enhancements.
   - Include instructions for deploying the app on *Google Cloud* for scalability and global reach.

8. *Submission-Ready Project:*
   - Ensure the app is fully functional, visually appealing, and aligned with the Google Solution Challenge judging criteria.
   - Provide a clear explanation of how the app addresses the UN SDGs and leverages Google technologies.

Please provide step-by-step guidance, code snippets, and resources to help me achieve this. The goal is to create a functional, innovative, and impactful waste management app that can win the Google Solution Challenge."
